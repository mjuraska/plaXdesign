Description: Considering a two-arm placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy trial with two periods of participant follow-up (period 1 and 2), computations are implemented for comparing the performance of a placebo crossover in period 2 design with that of a standard non-crossover design. Comparisons between the two trial designs in terms of statistical power to detect waning efficacy in period 2, power to detect vaccine harm in period 2 (e.g., due to vaccine-associated enhanced disease), and the sample size ratio yielding the same power for each aforementioned test, are available as described in Follmann et al. (2021) <doi: ...>.
