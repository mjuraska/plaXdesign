Description: Compares performance of placebo crossover and standard non-crossover two-arm vaccine efficacy trial designs with two periods of participant follow-up in terms of statistical power to detect waning efficacy in period 2, power to detect vaccine harm in period 2, and the sample size required to achieve the same power for each hypothesis test in period 2, as described in Follmann et al. (2020) <doi: ...>.
